                      A regular software developer on facebook. I do marketing,
                      and I try a little bit in writing code. I already know
                      what a git is and seem to understand how a git hub is
                      arranged. My dream is to create something extraordinary
                      where people can communicate with each other, send
                      messages and view photos. Well, it is possible to set
                      different statuses.

                      Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan
                      Spitalny: no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy,
                      but program offered courses in real estate, asset
                      management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
                      students gave positive reviews while studying, however
                      some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against
                      Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                      million to settle that...
